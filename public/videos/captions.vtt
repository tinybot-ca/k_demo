00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:01.969
Hi Jeff!

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.240
I hope this message finds you well.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.589
As you can see and hear, I thought I'd
follow-up on our BASF business development

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.590
discussion with something a little different.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.440
I have a ton of ideas when it comes to tools
and tactics regarding business development,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.450
I’d really love to help you.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.619
In this presentation, I’m going to focus
on one specific idea, and that’s, appropriately

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.810
enough, video.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.460
Specifically, personalized or targeted video.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.859
I just saw this video on Kenna’s YouTube
channel, I think it’s a great step in the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.240
right direction.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.980
And so my question is: how else might we be
able to leverage video to get into more doors

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.270
at BASF?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.920
These are numbers I pulled from BASF’s financial
statements online.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.860
The potential really speaks for itself.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.760
I actually think the kind of business development
help you want might not be, you know, the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.850
typical sales person who is just churning
through leads non-stop and focusing on quantity.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.980
I think it might actually be the opposite,
someone who can provide high quality touch,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.680
diplomacy, tact, you know - willing to play
the long game to win over new units and divisions

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.330
and decision makers.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.830
In terms of strategy, I suspect you’ve already
had a lot of internal discussions around these

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.920
points.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.170
Whether it’s expanding your suite of services
with existing relationships within BASF.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.069
Or, reaching out to new geographies within
existing BASF segments, for example, if you’re

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.170
already working with agchem in Canada and
the US, how do we approach agchem in Mexico

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.479
or Europe?

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.060
And finally, introducing services to non-engaged
segments.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.250
You know, perhaps finding a way to get involved
with the Master Builders program within the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
Construction group with Brian Denys, perhaps.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.359
So, what if we could do something to prime
the pump?

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.510
Something to get a prospective contact excited
in advance, so that when we do meet with them,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.840
it can be less about a typical capabilities
presentation and more about talking to them,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.120
understanding their unique challenges, and
how we’re best equipped to help them?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.310
So I think that takes care of the “why”
- why would we do this (leverage video)?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.649
But what about the “where”?

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.730
This is the customer lifecycle curve that
was a favourite at Digital Cement.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.860
So at which points would we leverage video
to complement our other business development

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
tactics?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.780
You know, the Kenna YouTube video, that would
be great fit, you know, under the Awareness

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.010
section.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.540
What if we could develop video content that
could accelerate engagement with prospective

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.180
contacts?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.930
And so here’s the “what”.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.480
What if we produced a really high quality
report for our existing projects in the form

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.740
of a project update or debrief?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.680
Right, so it doesn’t have to be something,
you know, super over-produced, but something

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.960
that conveys our professionalism and work
quality.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.150
Viewers would get a sense of what it would
be like to work with Kenna.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.521
And when our internal BASF supporters are
asked about their projects, you know, they

00:02:57.521 --> 00:03:03.709
can even proudly direct them to our securely
hosted, confidential video pages.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.650
Also, when we do get the opportunity to meet
with new people at BASF, this would be a great

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.020
library to draw on, something to show new
contacts what they can expect from us, that

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.030
sort of thing.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.650
So Jeff, I hope you’ve enjoyed this so far.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.220
I’m just going to wrap things up with a
quick personal update.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.400
You know, I’ve always really enjoyed being
that person that can bridge the business and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.050
technical teams.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.820
My original time at AppliCan and Kenna really
helped me to understand that one of the things

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.459
I enjoy most is leveraging technology to
solve business problems.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.450
Let me tell you a little bit about how I produced
this video and experience.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.099
I used Adobe Premiere and After Effects for
the video production.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.819
For the website, I used a PHP framework called
Laravel.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.840
It’s tools like Laravel and other open source
tools that really help enable me to create

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.860
fully functional prototypes.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.569
I really continue to be in love with the idea
that, you know, say on the flight back from

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.060
meeting with a client, that I can whip up
a fully functional demo that I could present

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.150
back to the client the very next day, right.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.370
It never ceases to impress, it’s always
kind of a crowd pleaser.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.099
People love seeing their words translated
into something tangible.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.810
It’s that great feeling you get when you
know your technology or marketing partner

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.519
really gets and understands you.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.669
As importantly, it’s really useful for delivering
incredibly detailed, accurate information

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.770
back to the development and delivery teams,
so that we can spend less time guessing and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.680
more time building high quality applications
with fewer issues, on a more aggressive timeline.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.550
So Jeff, I’ll end things here.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.400
Hopefully you found this to be a little fun.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.740
I’ll know when you watch this video, because
of course, it’ll appear in my analytics.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.350
But maybe what we could do next is arrange
some time to chat over the phone, maybe to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.410
just help you get a better sense of how exactly
I might be able to complement and help with

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.360
your business development efforts.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.020
Before I make my permanent move back to Toronto,
which should be some time later this year,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.690
I’d be happy to spend a few days here and
there with you at the Mississauga office,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.400
maybe help out on a part-time or contract
basis even, I mean I’m open to suggestions.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.930
Otherwise, I hope things are going well for
you Jeff, hope you get to really enjoy the

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.120
summer and I will talk to you soon!
